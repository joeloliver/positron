# Positron RAG: Adaptive RAG Techniques Study

An experimental project exploring advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with a focus on adaptive, query-aware processing to improve Q&A quality.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build an intelligent RAG system that dynamically decides which technique(s) to apply based on query characteristics, rather than applying all techniques uniformly. This approach aims to solve the common problem where relevant data exists in the vector database but isn't retrieved or reasoned about effectively.

## 📚 Techniques Under Study

### Retrieval Enhancement Techniques

| Technique | Description | When to Apply |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Query Rewriting** | Reformulates the original query to better align with document phrasing | Short, vague, or ambiguous queries |
| **Query Expansion** | Generates multiple query variations to increase retrieval coverage | Domains with synonyms or varied terminology |

### Reasoning & Processing Techniques

| Technique | Description | When to Apply |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Chain of Thought (CoT)** | Breaks down reasoning into step-by-step intermediate steps | Conflicting or dense information requiring analysis |
| **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** | Evaluates multiple reasoning paths and selects the best | Ambiguous queries with multiple valid interpretations |
| **ReAct** | Combines reasoning with actions, allowing dynamic re-querying | Multi-step Q&A or when initial retrieval is insufficient |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Optimizes prompts for better context utilization | Always (baseline optimization) |

## 🧪 Research Questions

1. **Query Classification**: How can we automatically detect which queries need rewriting vs. those that are already well-formed?
2. **Technique Combinations**: Which combinations of techniques yield the best improvements for different query types?
3. **Performance Trade-offs**: What's the latency vs. accuracy trade-off for each technique?
4. **Adaptive Thresholds**: How to set dynamic thresholds for triggering different techniques?

## 📝 Key Insights

> "Not all queries are equal — treat them differently"

The core innovation is recognizing that applying all RAG techniques to every query is inefficient and sometimes counterproductive. An adaptive approach that analyzes query characteristics first can significantly improve both performance and accuracy.
