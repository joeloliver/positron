# 🚀 Positron Mini

A minimal, efficient GPT implementation optimized for Apple Silicon (M-series chips) and designed for educational exploration of language model training and fine-tuning.

## ✨ Features

- **🍎 Apple Silicon Optimized**: Full M3 Max support with bfloat16 precision and MPS backend
- **⚡ Efficient Training**: Optimized batch sizes and memory usage for unified memory architecture  
- **🎯 Simple Fine-tuning**: Easy supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline
- **💬 Interactive Chat**: Built-in question-answering interface via `ask_model.sh`
- **📚 TinyStories Dataset**: Pre-configured for coherent story generation training

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Model**: 15M parameter GPT-style transformer
- **Context Length**: 512 tokens
- **Vocabulary**: 16,000 tokens (SentencePiece BPE)
- **Layers**: 8 transformer blocks with 8 attention heads

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup & Base Model Training

**Option A: Full Training (5000 steps at once)**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd positron-mini

# Train base model (optimized for M3 Max)
./bootstrap_tiny_llm.sh
```

**Option B: Incremental Training (Recommended)**
```bash
# Train in chunks - test quality at each step
./train_incremental.sh 1000    # 1000 steps per chunk
./train_incremental.sh 500     # Or 500 steps per chunk
```

**Incremental training benefits:**
- 🧪 **Test model quality** at 1K, 2K, 3K steps
- ⏸️ **Stop early** if quality is good enough  
- 🔄 **Resume anytime** - automatically continues from last checkpoint
- 🚫 **No time wasted** if training gets interrupted
- 🎯 **Interactive control** - you decide when to continue

Both will:
- Create virtual environment with optimized PyTorch
- Download and prepare TinyStories dataset  
- Train with Apple Silicon optimizations (bf16, MPS, optimized batching)
- Generate samples to test model quality

### 2. Supervised Fine-Tuning (Optional)
```bash
# Fine-tune for instruction following
./sft_quickstart.sh
```

### 3. Interactive Question Answering
```bash
# Ask questions to your model
./ask_model.sh

# Or single question mode
./ask_model.sh "Tell me about gravity"
```

### Training Tips

**For Better Results:**
- Use incremental training to test quality at each milestone
- Stop early if 2000-3000 steps give good enough results
- Experiment with learning rates (1e-4 to 5e-4)
- Try different temperature values for generation (0.1-1.0)

**For Faster Training:**
- Use bfloat16 precision on supported hardware  
- Train incrementally to avoid redoing work if interrupted
- Increase batch size if you have more memory
- Monitor GPU/MPS utilization

**Incremental Training Tips:**
```bash
# Quick experimentation
./train_incremental.sh 200   # 200 steps per chunk (very fast feedback)

# Balanced approach  
./train_incremental.sh 1000  # 1000 steps per chunk (recommended)

# Check if model is good enough at any point:
./ask_model.sh "Tell me a story"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Training Stuck?**
- Check if MPS is enabled: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())"`
- Monitor with: `ps aux | grep python`
- Reduce batch size if OOM errors

**Poor Generation Quality?**
- Ensure base model trained for 3000+ steps
- Try lower temperature (0.1-0.5) for more coherent text
- Check if SFT model exists and is properly trained

**Memory Issues?**
- Reduce `batch_tokens` in bootstrap script
- Use fp32 instead of bf16 if needed
- Monitor memory with Activity Monitor

## 📊 Training Metrics & Quality Evolution

**Typical Training Progress:**
```
[step 1/5000]    loss=9.756  lr=6.00e-07  ~7000 tok/s
[step 500/5000]  loss=6.234  lr=3.00e-04  ~7200 tok/s  
[step 2500/5000] loss=3.456  lr=1.50e-04  ~7100 tok/s
[step 5000/5000] loss=2.123  lr=0.00e+00  ~7000 tok/s
```

**Good Loss Targets:**
- **Base Training**: Start ~10.0, end ~2.0-3.0
- **Fine-tuning**: Start ~3.0, end ~1.5-2.5
